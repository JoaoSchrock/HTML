The all in one counter.



This counter displays Total Visits, people currently online, 

and the time / date that the user logged on. It uses a global.asa file to run. 


After unzipping,

install the global.asa file and the Counter.asp file in the SAME DIRECTORY.

You must make sure that whatever directory you install to, can run applications. 

You can set the properties of the directory up in Internet Services Manager. 

I would advise setting up a new directory and not stomping on your default global.asa file

in your wwwroot directory.

You can cut and paste the code from Counter.asp and install in your page anywhere you want.

I built a little table that looks cool but change it as you wish.


Depending on your web page background colors (which you can change the colors of the table 

I built for this counter in the Counter.asp file) using the <!--#include file="Counter.asp"--> option in 

your ASP page works beautifully to make this counter work for you.



I set the session timeout to 30 minutes so it should stop "not so nice people"

from clicking up endless false hits on you webpage (if that is a possible problem for anybody)

I'm always trying to think of new ideas to help people with their websites.


If you have any problems post a question to this website as I check quite often.



Enjoy!!!

And remember if you use and like this script vote for it on this website.
